# The Future of Web Development

The web is evolving at an unprecedented pace. With the advent of **React Server Components**, we are seeing a shift towards more server-centric rendering models that promise better performance and simplified data fetching.

## Key Trends

1. **Server Components**: Reducing bundle sizes and improving initial load times.
2. **AI Integration**: Copilots and generative UI are becoming standard.
3. **Edge Computing**: Moving logic closer to the user.

## Conclusion

As developers, we must stay adaptable and keep learning. The tools we use today might be obsolete tomorrow, but the fundamental principles of **user experience** and **performance** will always remain relevant.
