# Visual Storytelling

Words are powerful, but sometimes a picture is worth a thousand of them. We have updated our blog engine to support rich media, making it easier to tell compelling stories.

## Enhanced Images

Images now come with automatic rounded corners and a subtle dark overlay to blend perfectly with our dark theme. You can also add captions!

## Video Support

We also support embedded videos from YouTube, Vimeo, or local sources. The player is fully responsive.
